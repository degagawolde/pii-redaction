The user wants to make delicious chocolate chip cookies.
They need 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda,
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 cup of unsalted butter (softened), 3/4 cup of granulated sugar,
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 large eggs.
For the best part, they'll need 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
First, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Then, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour,
baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Gradually beat in the dry
ingredients until just combined. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded tablespoons
onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for 9 to 11 minutes.
